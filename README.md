# Stories sample app
## Notes
Showcases the feature of viewing stories in the social app

I 've decided to go over a broad set of feature.

It showcases a list of users and their stories in the top horizontal list.
You can scroll through them with the pagination.
You can view each user's story separately and navigate between stories and including other user's stories by tapping left or right part of the screen. 
You can like each story and it is saved using Swift Data
When you open and scroll the s they marked as "viewed"

I prioritized "vertical slice" of features and put less attention to individual interactions and transitions. 

### Libraries
I did not use any external libraries but the first one I would use would be image caching solution like SDWebImage.
